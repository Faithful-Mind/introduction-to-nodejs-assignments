# Module 4 Assignment Lab: REST API with Mongoose

A simple RESTful API, with Mongoose and MongoDB as persistent storage

## Walk through the design of this project.
The CRUD implementations is similar to the previous exmaple in module-2. I have encountered some dufficulties in implementing the update method. After referencing the solutions below, It's solved now.

## How to build
```bash
npm i
npm start
```
## How to test
Use the following test cases.
```bash
#posts account data
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"balance": "1000", "name": "savings"}' "http://localhost:3000/accounts"

#gets account data
curl "http://localhost:3000/accounts"

#updates account data at specific id, NOTE: replace 'id' in "http://localhost:3000/accounts/id" with the id generated by the previous POST command
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT -d '{"balance": "1500"}' "http://localhost:3000/accounts/id"

#deletes account data at specific id, NOTE: replace 'id' in "http://localhost:3000/accounts/id" with the id generated by the previous POST command
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/accounts/id"

```

or (if you have `httpie` installed)

```bash
#posts account data
http :3000/accounts name="savings" balance=1000

#gets account data
http :3000/acoounts

#updates account data at specific id, NOTE: replace 'id' in "http://localhost:3000/accounts/id" with the id generated by the previous POST command
http put :3000/accounts/id balance=1000

#deletes account data at specific id, NOTE: replace 'id' in "http://localhost:3000/accounts/id" with the id generated by the previous POST command
http delete :3000/accounts/id

```
